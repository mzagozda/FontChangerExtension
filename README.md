# Font Changer

This is my favourite browser extension that allows to choose custom fonts in order to override default fonts of any given website.

1. Clone the repo
2. Open Chrome and head to Extensions -> Manage Extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Press "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repo folder

## Usage

Click on the extension icon and a popup will appear. On it, you can change the font family, size, style and weight.
You can also add your own custom font.
